- 👋 Hi, I’m @beckyeng226
- 👀 I’m interested in learning whatever I can about data science.  I was a school psychologist in a school system for 16 years and decided to make a change.  I've been
exploring options in tech for a few years now and decided to extend my previous stats and research design methodology training into a career in data science.

- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the Data Science MS program at Eastern University.  I'm finishing the Fundamentals of Data Science course and will be starting the Python 
general programming class.  I have also done some work in Codecademy, including the Data Analyst Career Path, part of the Data Science Career Path,
and much of the Full Stack Career Path.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  That's a great question - I guess I'm still exploring because there are so many different things I'm interested in learning more
about but I haven't narrowed down to particular project ideas yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  You can find me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-vereb-eng/ or email me at rebecca.eng@eastern.edu.
